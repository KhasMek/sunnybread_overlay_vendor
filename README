To build, extract to ~/android/system/vendor. Do not rename. Run these commands via terminal:

cd ~/android/system
. build/envsetup.sh
lunch 
make otapackage

____________________

Note: You can speed up the compile by running this command: 

make -j# otapackage 

The # represents any number higher than 1. I usually compile with... 

make -j40 otapackage
